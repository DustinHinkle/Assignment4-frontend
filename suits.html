					Suits has been out for 9 seasons and I just found out about it thanks to Youtubes video recommendation algorithm, it is suprising as I always enjoy good entertaining shows that have to do with law, lawyers, and their decisions. This show follows Mike Ross, he has a photographic memory and ends up working for a large prestigious Harvard exclusive firm even though he never graduated from Harvard. I have only binged one season so far but I have hopes for it for a few seasons until I lose interest and the show becomes less interesting.

							I would rate this show from what I seen a solid 7 based on only the first season, I do have hopes for the other seasons that will be binged. For those who enjoy law I would describe this as a show that focus is mostly outside the courtroom but we do get our scenes still.
