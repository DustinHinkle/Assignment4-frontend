					Recently this year I have started watching new things and wish to share information about those shows I have seen and my thoughts.
				</p>
				<p>Things I have worked on in this assignment is 1. audio (dono page) 2. dono page. 3. animations transitions and transformations in regard to button. Now we got annoying buttons that spin around nonstop. Things we took away are ad area for lesser size screens a solution to this would be designing row space for ads when you have a lesser sized screen. However we have our ads on the left and right when the screen is at maximum settings. 4. scaling based on screen size (don't go too small!) we like the box on the side of the picture however the smaller the screen the worse off that would be so instead we call to wrap it when the screen is an appropriate size otherwise it is a stack. 5. I realized what I was seeing is not what you were seeing, as I had dark reader on and had a nice contrasting darker bars on the left and right implemented left and right bars on the sides so it looks as I intended for you. 6.Buttons rotating is silly and all but if trying to click it would maybe be annoying hovering over the button stops the animation with as I understand it completes the animation with hover and as long as you are still hovering it will not allow another animation to go through.</p>

						<p>While divs being added early was great and all I did not think of the scaling of the site for these later assignments. For should I do much more website creation, things I need to keep in mind are Modularity divs, blocks etc. and scaling design for the people who use a small screen and <s>disgust me</s> enjoy my content! Tried rotating an image to angle inward toward the text but it did not feel noticible I think with a border around an image it would be much more noticible.</p>
