					I have been enjoying House of the Dragon as it airs, it is hard to know what I will think about it later seeing as there are only 4 episodes out currently. House of the Dragon follows The Targaryians over a hundred years before the events in Game of Thrones. There are Dragons and they let you know early on, I have Hope for this show, perhaps I am more hopeful than I should be considering the last season of Game of Thrones. The main character to watch for is the princess how she grows and what will she do?

							As mentioned before only 4 episodes are out and there are a lot of Game of Thrones vibes. I would rate it as a 7, but that can change very quickly because this show is so new. That being said, I am not disappointed with the first 4 episodes.
