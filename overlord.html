				<h2>Overlord is a great show even in season 4</h2>

				<p>
					Overlord has consistently been one of my favorite shows. It follows our protagonist Ainz Oal Gown who is isekai'd (summon, reincarnated, or transfered to another world) from Japan to a world that was previously known to him as a videogame called Yggdrasil. This show explores the rejection of one's humanity in favor of power, answers, and memories.

							I rate this show as an 8.5 which is definitely one of my favorite shows of all time and have seen it multiple times enjoying exploring this new world with our protagonist as there is exciting combat as well as politics in this world between the kingdoms.
